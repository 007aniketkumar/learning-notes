# Escaping the Build Trap

The build trap is when organizations become stuck measuring their success by outputs rather than outcomes, when they focus more on shipping and developing features rather thant he actual value those things produce. When companies stop producing real value for the users, they begin to lose market share.

You need to look at the entire company, not just at the development team. Are you optimising your organisation to continually produce value? Are you set up to grow and sustain products as a company?

## The value exchange system

Companies end up in the build trap when they misunderstand value. Instead of associating value with outcomes, they measure value by the number of things they produce.

Customers realises _value_ when their problems are solved. Then and only then do they provide value back to the business. Every feature you build should result in some outcome that is tied back to that business value. **When companies do not understand their customers' or users' problems, they cannot possibility define value for them.**

Sometimes companies fall under the catch-up game, trying to fast-follow its competitors. This is what happened with Google+ and Facebook, never differentiating enough, just copying. Companies do also overpromise during their sales process, giving customers whatever they take to get the contract signed. The result is a ton of one-off features that satisfied the needs of only one client,r ather than a strategic choice to build what would scale for many clients.

Organisations get stuck in reactive mode, without building with intent. You have to get to know your customers and users, deeply understanding their needs. Companies need to get their employees closer to their customers and users so that they can learn from them.

## Constraints on the value exchange system

Your customers and users don't exist in a vacuum, their wants and needs change according to what's around them. The only thing we can do is understand them better to know how to act. Even thought businesses cannot control the customer side, they have full control over their own constraints.

> Raise your hand if you went back and iterated on the last thing you shipped

> How do you know that what you shipped was successful?

If your answer is around deadlines and finishing with bug-free code, you're likely in a company optimised for _outputs_ instead of _outcomes_. **_Outputs_ are easily quantified things that we produce, like the number of products, features, releases, velocity, etc. _Outcomes_ are the things that result when we finally deliver those features ant the customer problems are solved.**

For most companies, their entire structure is optimised to increase the output. To be strategic, we should define and measure value and then celebrate them for delivering on outcomes for our business and users.

## Project vs Products vs Services

* **Project** Scope out work to be done, create deadlines and milestones, and then have the team get to work.
* **Products** Deliver value repeatedly to customers and users, without requiring to build something new every time.
* **Services** Unlike products, they use human labor to primarily deliver value to the user.

Many companies use a combination of products and services to deliver value. **A _project_ is a discrete scope of work that has a particular aim. Projects are an essential part of product development, but the mentality of thinking only in projects will cause damage.**

A feature enhancement is a project, but your work may not be done when you are finished. You need to keep iterating by scoping out new projects to reach the overall outcome to be successful.

## The product-led organisation

**_Product-led_ companies understand that the success of their products is the primary driver of growth and value for their company.**

Many companies are instead lead by sales, visionaries or technology, which all land you in the build trap.

### Sales-led

Companies let their contracts define their product strategy. Like having 30 features that no-one uses.

Many small companies start of as sales-led, and that can be okay. This way of working does not scale for long. When you have 50 to 100 customers or more, you need to change your strategy to building features that apply to everyone, without customisation.

### Visionary-led

Consider Apple and Steve Jobs. These type of companies can be very powerful, when you have the right visionary. However, is not sustainable. Innovation needs to be baked in to the system so that one person is not the weakness link.

### Technology-led

Companies that are driven by the latest and coolest technology. They often suffer from the lak of a market-facing, value-led strategy.

Technology is critical to a software company success, but it cannot drive the product strategy. Product strategy connects the business, market, and technology together. You need to be able to lead with a value proposition for your users, or you will not be able to make money.

### Product-led

Companies that optimise for their business outcomes. You don't need to hire an entire new team, but changing the mindset is a challenge. **You need to begin focusing on outcomes and to adopt an experimental mindset to eliminate uncertainty that what you are building will reach your goals.**

## What we know and what we don't

Product development is full of uncertainty. It's important to separate out the facts from the things that we need to learn.

When kicking off a project, it's best to begin by identifying what you know to be true about the situation, your _known knowns_. Facts that you gather from data or critical requirements from customers.

You need to separate these items out as facts and to label those that you are unsure about as our _known unknowns_. Assumptions that you want to test, turn them into facts, and build to satisfy those facts.

**Although we should all listen to our intuition, you should be cautious because this is often where bias thrives.**

The _unknowns unknowns_ are the things that you don't know you don't know. They pop up during research.

**Product management is the domain of recognising and investigating the known unknowns and of reducing the universe around the unknown unknowns.**

Product managers identify features and products that will solve customer problems while achieving business goals. They optimise the Value Exchange System. **Product managers are the key to becoming product-led.**

### The role of a product manager

A Product manager deeply understands both the business and the customer. They are responsible for synthesising multiple pieces of data, and then determining in which direction the team should move. They keep the team focused on the _why_ are we building this product, and what outcome will it produce? The Chief Product Officer ties together the business outocmes to the roadmpap and represents its impact back to the board.

## Bad product manager archetypes

Under a _Waterfall_ process, the first step for a product manager is to talk to _internal stakeholders_ and ask them for their input and requests. This encourages product managers to always satisfy their stakeholders. After requirements are detailed out, they are usually handled to the designers to create an attractive-looking interface. After the product managers approve the designers' work, the software engineers can begin coding. Coding typically takes months, and for large projects, it can even take years.

Many companies have adopted Agile as it was a silver bullet. Agiles does indeed promote a better way of collaboration and faster method of building software, but it largely ignore how to do effective product management. When you go through the motions without active thinking, you end up with a lot of useless features. **We rarely teach product managers how to think, and even if we do, we don't measure this thinking process.**

Some common archetypes of bad product managers

### The mini-CEO

Product managers are not the mini-CEOs of a product. Product managers can't change many things a CEO can in an organisation. They don't have the authority over people â€“ because they are not people managers and they need to rely on influencing them. This is a very arrogant product manager archetype who thinks they rule the world.

**The job of a product manager is to produce value, not to develop your own ideas.**

> Start listening to your team. Involve them. Listen to your customers and focus on their problems instead of your own solutions. Fall in love with those problems. Validate your dideas. Turn to concrete evidence, rather than opinions.

Listening to everyone's opinion is important, but it doesn't mean a product manager should implement every suggestion.

### The waiter

This is a product manager who is an order taker. They go to their stakeholders, customers, or managers, ask for what they want, and turn those wants into a list of items to be developed. There is no goal. There is no vision. There is no decision making involved. This is usually the role of a _product owner_.

So, how these people prioritise? More often than not, the most important person gets their features prioritised. Instead of discovering problems, waiters ask "What do you want?"

They implement ideas without validating them. **It's not the customer's job to come up with their own solutions. That is the product manager job.**

Waiters are reactive thinkers, not strategic thinkers. Pushing back is essential to building a successful product.

**Project managers who are put into product management roles often become waiters waving a calendar.**

### The former project manager

Product managers are not project managers. Project managers are responsible for the _when_. Product managers are responsible for the _why_, why are we building this? How does it deliver value to our customers? How does it help meet the goals of the business?

**Agile methodologies distribute the responsibilities of the project manager across the team. These cross-functional teams have all the key players dedicated to ship a feature, so less coordination is needed across departments. Thus, project management is not needed.**

Answering _why_ is very different than answering _when_. It requires a strategic mindset.

## A great product manager

The role of a product manager is to work with a team to create the right product that balances business needs with solving user problems. They understand many sides of the company. They need to understand the market and how the business works. They need to truly understand the vision and the goal of the company. They must have deep empathy for the users.

**The "product manager" title is misleading, as an effective product manager is not really a manager. To be effective, product managers need to recognise team members' strengths and work with them to achieve the common goal. They need to convince their team and the company on the things they are working are the right things to be building. Influencing skills are essential.**

Product managers really own the _why_, of what they are building. **They work with the team to develop ideas and jump in once requirements get validated to make sure that the product being created achieves the goals of the customer, user, and business. It's the team, collectively, that really owns the product, the _what_.**

Product managers should be at the helm of experimentation. Product managers connect the dots. They must be humble, they recognise they don't know all the answers.

**The ultimate goal for a product manager is to reduce the risk by focusing on learning.**

### Tech expert versus market expert

Great product managers will get further by taking advantage of the skills and expertise of their team. **Product management is about looking at the entire system and figuring out how it can product revenue for the company.** Product managers need to know just enough to talk with an engineer or a business person. **A product manager must be tech literate, not tech fluent in order to make good trade-off decisions.**

Although it's valuable for a product manager to know the market well, this is something they can learn.

### A great product manager

Always focus on the problem. If you anchor yourself with the _why_, you will be more likely to build the right thing.

### Start with the _why_

* Why are we making everything digital in the mortgage space?
* Why even do this project?
* What's the desired result that we hope to achieve here?
* What does success look like?
* What happens if we make it all digital and nobody applies for mortgages?
* How are we mitigating that risk?

Too often, product managers dive into creating solutions without thinking through the associated risks.

When organisations hand down solutions, they skip setting success metrics and goals.

The biggest issue reported by leaders is that product managers won't step up and "own the product". Product managers can and should question solutions and push back on things handed down. However, the work required to gather data and prove the solution takes time.

There is some confusion between a _product owner_ and a _product manager_. In Scrum literature, a product owner:
* Define the product backlog and create actionable user stories for the development teams.
* Groom and prioritise the work in the backlog.
* Accept the completed user stories to make sure the work fulfills the criteria.

**Product owner is a _role_ you play on a Scrum team. Product manager is a _career_.** Product management and Scrum can work well together, but product management is not dependent on Scrum.

**Most organisations do not give their people the necessary time to do product vision and research work. They would rather hold them responsible for a steady stream of outputs and measure success based on stacking backlogs and writing stories.**

Product managers play some key roles, but one of the most important ones is being able to marry the business goals with the customer goals to achieve value. Good product managers figure out how to achieve goals for the business by creating or optimising products, all with a view toward solving actual customer problems.

### One role, many responsibilities

Without a Scrum team or with a smaller team, you might be doing more strategy and validation work for a product that has not been defined yet. With a Scrum team, you might be more focused on the execution of solutions. As a manager of product managers, you might be leading strategy for a larger part of the product and coaching your teams to discover and execute well.

**With a good strategy framework in place and ruthless prioritisation around a few key goals, one person can effectively talk to customers, understand their problems, and help to define the solutions with the team.**

### The product manager career path

_Tactical work_ for a product manager focuses on the shorter-term actions of building features and getting out of the door, scoping out work and crunching the data to determine what to do next.

_Strategic work_ is about positioning the product and the company to win in the market and achieve goals, it looks like the future state of the product and company.

_Operational work_ is about tying the strategy back to the tactical work. Here is were Product Managers create a roadmap that connects the current and the future state of the product.

#### Associate product manager

Open up this role to people making the switch into product management. Pair them with a senior product manager to teach them the ropes.

#### Product manager

Works with a development team and UX designers to ideate and build the right solutions for the customers, talking to users, synthesising the data, making the decisions from a feature perspective. Product managers are usually responsible for a feature or a set of features part of a larger product.

The product manager needs to be strategic enough to help craft the vision of the features and how they fit into the overall product but tactical enough to ensure a smooth execution of the solution. They tend to skew more operational than strategic at this level due to their shorter-term impact the delivery of the roadmap.

The danger is when a product manager is 100% operational, focusing only on shipping products and not on optimising the feature. When they optimise for the day-to-day execution of the team they usually fall behind in the necessary strategy and vision for the features to succeed. **It's imperative to push back as much project management effort as possible to the team and trust them to deliver.**

Product managers are part of a larger product team, feeding data about the success of features to product people. This helps inform the strategy and direction of the product portfolio and organisation.

#### Senior product manager

Same as product managers but they also oversee more scope or a more complex product. It is as high in the product management field as you can go as an individual contributor. They want to focus on building products instead of growing a team. You must balance being highly strategic and highly operational.

This role is for people who like difficult product problems. They are usually entrepreneurial, and that's a great trait because they will be the ones to start new product lines for businesses.

#### Director of product

At a certain point, the company will grow enough that there are too many people reporting into the head of product. A director of product becomes necessary to help promote strategic alignment and operational efficiency.

They oversee a group of product managers who are aligned around a product in a portfolio or a product line. They ar responsible for the strategic roadmap of the product, making sure all product managers are aligned by the appropriate goals and working in the most important items to move the product forward.

#### VP of product

This is someone who oversees the strategy and operations for an entire product line. They set the vision and goals for the overall product. In large enterprises they are also directly responsible for financial success of their product line, not just the delivery of product features.

A VP of product is usually the highest level in smaller companies because there is only one product and not multiple product lines. A successful VP of product needs to fundamentally be more of a strategic person and they know that in order to scale their organisation, they need to hire in people who take over the tactical and operational components.

#### Chief product officer

A CPO oversees a company's entire product portfolio and they ensure it works together to achieve the company goals. Although a VP of product needs to understand how their product roadmap affects the economics of the company, a CPO needs to do that across all products. They work with VPs of product to ensure that every product is strategically aligned to the company's objectives and each product has what it needs, from a resource and people perspective, to reach the established goals.

A CPO needs to be able to interface at the board level. A successful CPO needs to be able to translate their actions into terms the board will understand.

> They inspire confidence, empathise, and are relentless and resilient

To inspire confidence, **CPOs work across many functions to gain buy-in and alignment, they get through things through influence versus direct authority**. By empathising with the other members of their peer group, their customers and their teams, CPOs can find a way forward that aligns all the goals.

Finally, a CPO must be relentless and resilient. They need to desire to dig in and find out what is working and what is not, assessing and analysing, trying to prove their hypothesis right and wrong, and holding themselves accountable to data.

Having a strong product leader in the C-Suite is a critical step to becoming product-led.

### Organising your teams

Companies tend to organise in three main ways: value streams, features, and technical components.

Teams organised around features usually do so in order to get ownership over every part of the product, although this is good if you are starting from scratch, it promotes a very output-oriented mindset. We tend to look for ways to develop more things related to our little slice of the product. When features are stable, we should monitor them and then move on to more important work needed to support our strategy.

When companies are small, you can organise effectively around goals you are trying to reach. This is the case for TransferWise. One team is focused on retention, another on implementing new currencies, and another on acquiring customers. Each of these teams has ownership of their goal and is judged for success based on their outcomes. It takes a huge amount of coordination across the product teams, so everyone is responsible for collaborating intensely with one another. This structure creates a nice redundancy across the company, so important information about a single product is not stuck in the head of one person.

As companies scale, this may not be a viable option. A _value stream_ is all activities needed to deliver value to the customer. That includes process from discovering the problem, setting goals, and conceiving of the idea, to delivering the actual product or service. Every organisation should strive to optimise this flow in order to get value out the door faster to customers, and in order to do so, it makes sense to organise your teams around the value stream.

First you begin with the customer or user, whomever is consuming your product at the end of the day. What is the value that you are providing to them? Then work backward. FInd the touchpoints they have with your company to receive that value. How do you organise to optimise and streamline that journey for them? How do you optimise to provide more value, faster?

Many companies are confused by the word _product_. If your app, interface, or feature is not inherently adding value on its own, it's just a piece of the entire product. You have to look beyond just that piece to understand how to manage for value delivery and creation.

For example, car insurance provides peace of mind in case you get into an accident, that's value. An iPhone app that allows you to manage your car insurance is only a piece of that product's value stream; the app on its own is not enough value.

You can still have a product manager owning that iPhone app experience, but you must make sure that they are part of a larger division that holds the true value, the car insurance division. This structure makes it possible to set strategy at the division level. with the product manager able to execute on product initiatives that tie to their product. Keeping the strategy and the value execution together is key.

By minimising the number of layers and by giving product managers more scope over their product areas, you can effectively create a product organisation with a structure that supports the product strategy.

#### Marquetly's product team

> The company had 20 product teams organised around components. "How should we build this organisation?" "We need to restructure around value streams". We needed to start by hiring an experienced chief product officer. We have a great VP of product, good at the tactical and strategic work for a single product vision, but unfortunately she doesn't understand how to manage a portfolio of products. We also need more senior people.
>
> You can't build an organisational structure without a product vision, because the value streams are not apparent.
>
> To make considerable impact, you need to have everyone going in the same direction, working toward the same goals.

## Strategy

A good strategy is not a plan; it's a framework that helps you make decisions. Product strategy connects the vision and economic outcomes of the company back to product portfolio, individual product initiatives, and solution options for the teams. Strategy creation is the process of determining the direction of the company and developing the framework in which people make decisions.
