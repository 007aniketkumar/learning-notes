# Escaping the Build Trap

The build trap is when organizations become stuck measuring their success by outputs rather than outcomes, when they focus more on shipping and developing features rather thant he actual value those things produce. When companies stop producing real value for the users, they begin to lose market share.

You need to look at the entire company, not just at the development team. Are you optimising your organisation to continually produce value? Are you set up to grow and sustain products as a company?

## The value exchange system

Companies end up in the build trap when they misunderstand value. Instead of associating value with outcomes, they measure value by the number of things they produce.

Customers realises _value_ when their problems are solved. Then and only then do they provide value back to the business. Every feature you build should result in some outcome that is tied back to that business value. **When companies do not understand their customers' or users' problems, they cannot possibility define value for them.**

Sometimes companies fall under the catch-up game, trying to fast-follow its competitors. This is what happened with Google+ and Facebook, never differentiating enough, just copying. Companies do also overpromise during their sales process, giving customers whatever they take to get the contract signed. The result is a ton of one-off features that satisfied the needs of only one client,r ather than a strategic choice to build what would scale for many clients.

Organisations get stuck in reactive mode, without building with intent. You have to get to know your customers and users, deeply understanding their needs. Companies need to get their employees closer to their customers and users so that they can learn from them.

## Constraints on the value exchange system

Your customers and users don't exist in a vacuum, their wants and needs change according to what's around them. The only thing we can do is understand them better to know how to act. Even thought businesses cannot control the customer side, they have full control over their own constraints.

> Raise your hand if you went back and iterated on the last thing you shipped

> How do you know that what you shipped was successful?

If your answer is around deadlines and finishing with bug-free code, you're likely in a company optimised for _outputs_ instead of _outcomes_. **_Outputs_ are easily quantified things that we produce, like the number of products, features, releases, velocity, etc. _Outcomes_ are the things that result when we finally deliver those features ant the customer problems are solved.**

For most companies, their entire structure is optimised to increase the output. To be strategic, we should define and measure value and then celebrate them for delivering on outcomes for our business and users.

## Project vs Products vs Services

* **Project** Scope out work to be done, create deadlines and milestones, and then have the team get to work.
* **Products** Deliver value repeatedly to customers and users, without requiring to build something new every time.
* **Services** Unlike products, they use human labor to primarily deliver value to the user.

Many companies use a combination of products and services to deliver value. **A _project_ is a discrete scope of work that has a particular aim. Projects are an essential part of product development, but the mentality of thinking only in projects will cause damage.**

A feature enhancement is a project, but your work may not be done when you are finished. You need to keep iterating by scoping out new projects to reach the overall outcome to be successful.

## The product-led organisation

**_Product-led_ companies understand that the success of their products is the primary driver of growth and value for their company.**

Many companies are instead lead by sales, visionaries or technology, which all land you in the build trap.

### Sales-led

Companies let their contracts define their product strategy. Like having 30 features that no-one uses.

Many small companies start of as sales-led, and that can be okay. This way of working does not scale for long. When you have 50 to 100 customers or more, you need to change your strategy to building features that apply to everyone, without customisation.

### Visionary-led

Consider Apple and Steve Jobs. These type of companies can be very powerful, when you have the right visionary. However, is not sustainable. Innovation needs to be baked in to the system so that one person is not the weakness link.

### Technology-led

Companies that are driven by the latest and coolest technology. They often suffer from the lak of a market-facing, value-led strategy.

Technology is critical to a software company success, but it cannot drive the product strategy. Product strategy connects the business, market, and technology together. You need to be able to lead with a value proposition for your users, or you will not be able to make money.

### Product-led

Companies that optimise for their business outcomes. You don't need to hire an entire new team, but changing the mindset is a challenge. **You need to begin focusing on outcomes and to adopt an experimental mindset to eliminate uncertainty that what you are building will reach your goals.**

## What we know and what we don't

Product development is full of uncertainty. It's important to separate out the facts from the things that we need to learn.

When kicking off a project, it's best to begin by identifying what you know to be true about the situation, your _known knowns_. Facts that you gather from data or critical requirements from customers.

You need to separate these items out as facts and to label those that you are unsure about as our _known unknowns_. Assumptions that you want to test, turn them into facts, and build to satisfy those facts.

**Although we should all listen to our intuition, you should be cautious because this is often where bias thrives.**

The _unknowns unknowns_ are the things that you don't know you don't know. They pop up during research.

**Product management is the domain of recognising and investigating the known unknowns and of reducing the universe around the unknown unknowns.**

Product managers identify features and products that will solve customer problems while achieving business goals. They optimise the Value Exchange System. **Product managers are the key to becoming product-led.**

### The role of a product manager

A Product manager deeply understands both the business and the customer. They are responsible for synthesising multiple pieces of data, and then determining in which direction the team should move. They keep the team focused on the _why_ are we building this product, and what outcome will it produce? The Chief Product Officer ties together the business outocmes to the roadmpap and represents its impact back to the board.

## Bad product manager archetypes

Under a _Waterfall_ process, the first step for a product manager is to talk to _internal stakeholders_ and ask them for their input and requests. This encourages product managers to always satisfy their stakeholders. After requirements are detailed out, they are usually handled to the designers to create an attractive-looking interface. After the product managers approve the designers' work, the software engineers can begin coding. Coding typically takes months, and for large projects, it can even take years.

Many companies have adopted Agile as it was a silver bullet. Agiles does indeed promote a better way of collaboration and faster method of building software, but it largely ignore how to do effective product management. When you go through the motions without active thinking, you end up with a lot of useless features. **We rarely teach product managers how to think, and even if we do, we don't measure this thinking process.**

Some common archetypes of bad product managers

### The mini-CEO

Product managers are not the mini-CEOs of a product. Product managers can't change many things a CEO can in an organisation. They don't have the authority over people â€“ because they are not people managers and they need to rely on influencing them. This is a very arrogant product manager archetype who thinks they rule the world.

**The job of a product manager is to produce value, not to develop your own ideas.**

> Start listening to your team. Involve them. Listen to your customers and focus on their problems instead of your own solutions. Fall in love with those problems. Validate your dideas. Turn to concrete evidence, rather than opinions.

Listening to everyone's opinion is important, but it doesn't mean a product manager should implement every suggestion.

### The waiter

This is a product manager who is an order taker. They go to their stakeholders, customers, or managers, ask for what they want, and turn those wants into a list of items to be developed. There is no goal. There is no vision. There is no decision making involved. This is usually the role of a _product owner_.

So, how these people prioritise? More often than not, the most important person gets their features prioritised. Instead of discovering problems, waiters ask "What do you want?"

They implement ideas without validating them. **It's not the customer's job to come up with their own solutions. That is the product manager job.**

Waiters are reactive thinkers, not strategic thinkers. Pushing back is essential to building a successful product.

**Project managers who are put into product management roles often become waiters waving a calendar.**

### The former project manager

Product managers are not project managers. Project managers are responsible for the _when_. Product managers are responsible for the _why_, why are we building this? How does it deliver value to our customers? How does it help meet the goals of the business?

**Agile methodologies distribute the responsibilities of the project manager across the team. These cross-functional teams have all the key players dedicated to ship a feature, so less coordination is needed across departments. Thus, project management is not needed.**

Answering _why_ is very different than answering _when_. It requires a strategic mindset.

## A great product manager

The role of a product manager is to work with a team to create the right product that balances business needs with solving user problems. They understand many sides of the company. They need to understand the market and how the business works. They need to truly understand the vision and the goal of the company. They must have deep empathy for the users.

**The "product manager" title is misleading, as an effective product manager is not really a manager. To be effective, product managers need to recognise team members' strengths and work with them to achieve the common goal. They need to convince their team and the company on the things they are working are the right things to be building. Influencing skills are essential.**

Product managers really own the _why_, of what they are building. **They work with the team to develop ideas and jump in once requirements get validated to make sure that the product being created achieves the goals of the customer, user, and business. It's the team, collectively, that really owns the product, the _what_.**

Product managers should be at the helm of experimentation. Product managers connect the dots. They must be humble, they recognise they don't know all the answers.

**The ultimate goal for a product manager is to reduce the risk by focusing on learning.**

### Tech expert versus market expert

Great product managers will get further by taking advantage of the skills and expertise of their team. **Product management is about looking at the entire system and figuring out how it can product revenue for the company.** Product managers need to know just enough to talk with an engineer or a business person. **A product manager must be tech literate, not tech fluent in order to make good trade-off decisions.**

Although it's valuable for a product manager to know the market well, this is something they can learn.

### A great product manager

Always focus on the problem. If you anchor yourself with the _why_, you will be more likely to build the right thing.

### Start with the _why_

* Why are we making everything digital in the mortgage space?
* Why even do this project?
* What's the desired result that we hope to achieve here?
* What does success look like?
* What happens if we make it all digital and nobody applies for mortgages?
* How are we mitigating that risk?

Too often, product managers dive into creating solutions without thinking through the associated risks.

When organisations hand down solutions, they skip setting success metrics and goals.

The biggest issue reported by leaders is that product managers won't step up and "own the product". Product managers can and should question solutions and push back on things handed down. However, the work required to gather data and prove the solution takes time.

There is some confusion between a _product owner_ and a _product manager_. In Scrum literature, a product owner:
* Define the product backlog and create actionable user stories for the development teams.
* Groom and prioritise the work in the backlog.
* Accept the completed user stories to make sure the work fulfills the criteria.

**Product owner is a _role_ you play on a Scrum team. Product manager is a _career_.** Product management and Scrum can work well together, but product management is not dependent on Scrum.

**Most organisations do not give their people the necessary time to do product vision and research work. They would rather hold them responsible for a steady stream of outputs and measure success based on stacking backlogs and writing stories.**

Product managers play some key roles, but one of the most important ones is being able to marry the business goals with the customer goals to achieve value. Good product managers figure out how to achieve goals for the business by creating or optimising products, all with a view toward solving actual customer problems.

### One role, many responsibilities

Without a Scrum team or with a smaller team, you might be doing more strategy and validation work for a product that has not been defined yet. With a Scrum team, you might be more focused on the execution of solutions. As a manager of product managers, you might be leading strategy for a larger part of the product and coaching your teams to discover and execute well.

**With a good strategy framework in place and ruthless prioritisation around a few key goals, one person can effectively talk to customers, understand their problems, and help to define the solutions with the team.**
